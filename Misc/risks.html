			<li>Boardgames are often used as more of a social lubricant than a main event. ​This can be diminished or altogether lost when played over a digital space.​ (Rogerson et al., 2016)</li>
				<p><pre>
						You can easily loose the major social aspect and essence of playing a boardgame with someone. Half of playing a boardgame isn't the boardgame itself but the time spent with those you are playing with. 
					Infact many people say that during game nights, the game often takes a backseat in favor of chatting and generally having fun with other people. Boardgames are used as a social lubricant, a way to get 
					people interacting with each other and associate it with fun. In terms of computerizing this, it comes to question whether this social interaction can as effectively be carried out over a digital space 
					where you cannot physically interact with others or the game pieces.

			<li>​Digitizing and automating rule enforcement on computer board games undermines the human players' control. Less flexibility, fun and enjoyment.​ (Pape, 2012)</li>

			<li>Online card gambling has been also increasing, and with not enough security to stop underage people from taking part.​ (Gainsbury, 2012)</li>
