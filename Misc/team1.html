		<p><pre>
		I found that our topic was very important because the board games that we talk about in the project is 
		games that our entire group played when we were younger. It is very important to us that the games that future
		generations will have the same content that it originally had.
		
		The risks to updating the game onto a computer is they might change the rules. Out of the ways to combat this 
		that our team found, I liked the idea that the programmer can make the game adaptable on the users end so that
		the players can change the rules.
		
		This would allow positive change for the new players while allowing the older players to still play like they
		used to. 
		
		Another risk that I thought was important to research was the online gambling issue.
