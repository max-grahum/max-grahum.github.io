Ethics are the systems of moral principles or rules that influence how people behave or how things 
are done (Oxford University Press, n.d.). This in terms of our technology can be applied in a couple ways.

The first being how these board games are transferred onto the digital platform. If for starters they 
have the creators or copyright holder’s permission to adapt the game. If they do not, they are acting 
unethically through stealing (as that is a rule in acting ethically, to not steal) the game and making 
it their own on a different platform. Then if they do have permission, do they put their best into 
making it a well-adapted game, or do they not bother with it, doing the minimum work and creating a 
barely functioning game. It would be unethical to not honour the original game and to make an effort 
for it to be well made when working on an adaptation.

To adapt a board game to be digitised, you have the rule that the game plays the same, only without a 
physical plane. It comes to question as to how these games are adapted. By that I mean, do they hold 
the original intentions, do the adapters consider and stay true to the original designs and workings 
of the game, or do they take liberties. Is it ethical to take a board game and to make a digitized 
version which does not follow the game's intention, or lesson, or general game play? If you are 
advertising a digital version of Snakes and Ladders, but instead have a game more similar to that of 
Connect Four, or something that just is not played the same as Snakes and Ladders is in physical form 
(minus the materiality), players and the original creator of the board game would feel, and rightfully 
so, cheated.

Ethics in this field, or the rules influencing the way board games are adapted onto computers, is 
vitally important. As to not follow these rules, morals are compromised, laws can be broken, and it is 
possible that the games are not truly digitised therefore tainting the original board games for future 
generations who only know the version they played on a computer.

My recommendations for avoiding these negative outcomes is simply,
Reporting stolen material (as it is practically impossible to stop copyright infringement before it 
happens and is uploaded), having someone or a system for quality control throughout the adaptation 
process, and if possible include the creators or main manufacturers on whichever board game it is that 
is being digitised in the process. 
Other than that, just having a strong moral compass is the only thing that can really help maintain the 
ethics of adapting board games onto computers.
