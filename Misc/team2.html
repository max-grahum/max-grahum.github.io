		One ethical issue  with the adaption of board games onto computers the potential
		danger of meeting strangers online. 
		
		Digital board games provide a perfect platform for dangerous individuals
		to come into contact with vulnerable people such as young people behind a disguise of anonymity. 
		
		It is hard for young people, especially kids to distinguish between predators on online 
		games based on words alone especially when there is no physical image of what they look like. 
		
		Ultimately what this means is that a significant amount of harm can be inflicted upon 
		vulnerable people through platforms such as digital board games which have this kind of dangerous behaviour.
		
		This is one thing that should be considered by game developers whilst adapting board games onto computers 
		and to figure out solutions or ways to solve this issue and protect their users.
		
		One recommendation to solve this is the monitoring of communication channels to 
		ensure there is no kind of dangerous or predatory behaviour occurring their games. 
		
		Obviously, communication is a huge part of what makes a board game enjoyable and
		therefore to entirely remove the option of uses communicating with each other is absurd and is therefore not a option. 
		
		However, monitoring these communication channels would be an effective and secure way of maintaining a
		safe environment for all users to have whilst playing board games. 

 

		I believe that the adaptation of board games onto computer have been an overall positive influence on the world and society.  
		Board games which have been traditionally isolated to only a small group or circle of friends can now be played with and 
		accessed by different people from across the globe. 
		
		The massive internet usage and accessibility in the 21st century have provided anyone with an internet connection the
		opportunity to make friends and connect with people instantly over online board games. 
		
		The amount of social good board games has done for various people is immeasurable as friendships and social interactions are priceless. 
		
		This is especially true in cases of lockdown where physical meetings are restricted so these digital meetups through games act as a
		substitute for that face-to-face connection. 
		
		Of course, there are several risks to adaptation of board games on computers in the fact that it is not as socially enjoyable to play 
		with online than it is in person and that automating rule enforcement takes away control from the human players and fun. 
		
		However, these risks can be mitigated by choosing appropriate online board games which enable lots of social interaction and
		connections as well as preserving the fundamental rules of the physical game onto the digital version and allowing for user control
		over different aspects of the rules settings.
