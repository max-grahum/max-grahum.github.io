		<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
		
		</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Boardgames are often used as more of a social lubricant than a main event. ​This can be diminished or altogether lost when played over a digital space.​ (Rogerson et al., 2016)</li>
				<p><pre>
		You can easily loose the major social aspect and essence of playing a boardgame with someone. Half of playing a boardgame isn't the boardgame itself but the time spent with those you are playing with. 
	Infact many people say that during game nights, the game often takes a backseat in favor of chatting and generally having fun with other people. Boardgames are used as a social lubricant, a way to get 
	people interacting with each other and associate it with fun. In terms of computerizing this, it comes to question whether this social interaction can as effectively be carried out over a digital space 
	where you cannot physically interact with others or the game pieces.

			<li>​Digitizing and automating rule enforcement on computer board games undermines the human players' control. Less flexibility, fun and enjoyment.​ (Pape, 2012)</li>
				<p><pre>
		One of the most fun aspects of playing board games with friends is the ability to change the game however you want, such as the rules and how the games work. 
	
	Digitization and automation of rule enforcement can hurt the boardgame experience.
	Instead of members in the group carrying out the rules and punishments in some games, the computer does it automatically.
	This means that the human players lose some control over how the game is played out by not being able to enforce their own unique set of rules.
	Changing the rules however you want is what makes the games fun.
	Everyone has their own unique rules and how they play the game (Uno, Cards).
				</pre></p>
				
			<li>Online card gambling has been also increasing, and with not enough security to stop underage people from taking part.​ (Gainsbury, 2012)</li>
				<p><pre>
		With more and more board games going digital it is not a suprise that the adult games that contain gambling has also been taking online.
	The issue arises when there is not enough security to stop people that should not be gambling from taking part such as children and people that 
	have addictions and should not be gambling for their health and financial wellbeing.
