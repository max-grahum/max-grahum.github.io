I found that our topic was very important because the board games that we talk about in the project is 
games that our entire group played when we were younger. It is very important to us that the games that 
future generations will have the same content that it originally had.
		
The risks to updating the game onto a computer is they might change the rules. Out of the ways to combat
this that our team found, I liked the idea that the programmer can make the game adaptable on the users
end so that the players can change the rules.
		
This would allow positive change for the new players while allowing the older players to still play like 
they used to. 
		
Another risk that I thought was important to research was the online gambling issue. The main ethical 
issue with online gambling becoming much more popular and accessible, is the lack of security that has 
come with it shown in Wickwire, E. M. et al. (2007) journal. Online security systems are much easier to trick and to get past than in person security 
systems which means that people that should not be gambling like people that are addicted and children. 

This is worrying because gambling is dangerous when you donâ€™t understand the risks and consequences of 
gambling. I would like to know that future generations of children will not be able to gamble without 
understanding these dangers that come with it. 

The solution is not just one small fix, it's a bit more complicated than that. I found that the best 
idea was to educate people at a younger age to try to steer people away from gambling as much as possible. 
While this is happening it would also be good to increase the security on these sites by creating more 
checks and ways to find out information such as age and background before letting the person use the 
site to gamble such as was presented in Huckle, T., et al. (2009) article.
