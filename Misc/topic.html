		<p><pre>
				Our topic is about how physical games such as board games and card games have been popularised while being adapted to work on a computer. We picked it because while 
			brainstorming we thought of the idea of the game uno. Uno is a card game that had been changed to be playable on a computer, that idea evolved into how games had
			been adapted to be played on a computer. Physical games are becoming less popular because of computers becoming more accessible And because of this future
			generations might not be able to get a board game. We believe our topic is important because we grew up with board games and it's important to know that they will
			be able to change to be more accessible so that future generations can access them while still retaining the idea behind the game.
