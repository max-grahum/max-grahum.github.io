		<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
		
		</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the opportunities presented by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li>More people will have access to board games if they are digitized. This is shown in Olson's (2014), blog post. ​</li>
				<p><pre>
		In Olson's blog post he talks about how chess has become exponentially more popular over time showing that through digitization, 
	the game is broad cast to a larger group of people making the media a stronger influencer. 
					
				</pre></p>

			<li>Improvements can be made to the game to increase user experience overall making the product better. (Barbara, 2015)​</li>
				<p><pre>
		It is hard to get everyone that owns a physical game to change the games rules or update how it's played because it's written in paper.
	Online games however can have updates be sent out to all the users to change the user experience of the game. The users experience 
	will determine how the game is perceived which is why it is important to look at both the virtual and physical experiences. 
				</pre></p>
				
			<li>A way to connect people when they're unable to see each other in person.​ Such as during a COVID-19 lockdown.​ (Marston & Kowert, 2020)</li>
				<p><pre>
		In situations where people cannot be together or are isolated from others (much like the current world’s situation with COVID-19),
	computerized games are a great way to still be able to socialize and connect. When playing a game with another person, you not only have
	the general social aspect of interacting with others, but the connection is done through playing together. This creates an effect of stress 
	reduction and the release of endorphins. Compared to the socialization you have with simply texting someone computer games are 
	psychologically more beneficial.
